## Description

- Happy Paws Pet Shelter, a project built in JAVA Swing framework.

- The capacity to report stray animals across geographical boundaries and the ability to keep track of their welfare once they are placed in shelter homes were the project's core ideas.

- The major goal of the initiative was to make it easier to report stray animals from different locations and to maintain track of them after they are housed in shelters.

- In addition, the system could handle various users across the ecosystem, from the user to the pet shelter office administration and field workers, and it had over 18 user roles ranging across multiple networks and involved 8 primary workflows. Additionally, it provided the pet sanctuary with the option to request access to the supply chain and medical facilities.

- At various stages throughout the project, AbsoluteLayout, BorderLayout, and CardLayout were used as needed.

- The project was based on an ecosystem paradigm that permitted both vertical and horizontal scalability.

-The administrator could add more hospitals, NGOs, merchant and pet training school groups as well as more operating cities/network. Each category may contain several organizations.

- The idea was that while users are not considered to be employees of any particular organization, their functions are distinct within the system.
No employee is permitted to report a pet, and users (those who report the pet) are also not permitted to directly seek food or medical care for an unattended animal.
In order to have a simpler approach with better roles for all of our entities, this was avoided.
